 # Maven MegaMart Project

Maven MegaMar is planning to acquire another retailer to expand our market share. As part of the due diligence process, theyâ€™ve sent us over several tables relating to their customers and sales.

## Key Objectives:
 Read in data from multiple csv files 
 Explore the data (millions of rows!) 
 Join multiple DataFrames
 Create new columns to aid in analysis 
 Filter, sort, and aggregate the data to pinpoint and summarize important information
 Work with datetime fields to analyze time series 
 Build plots to communicate key insights
 Optimize the import workflow 
 Write out summary tables for stakeholders
